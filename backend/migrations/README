Generic single-database configuration.

## Usage
Run migrations with:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Troubleshooting

**If you see** "Can't locate revision identified by '...'" after restoring or changing migrations, you can either:

1. Create a stub migration matching that revision ID (see example in `migrations/versions/2cfa4a2ad8a1_create_missing_revision.py`), or
2. Stamp the database to the current head with:

   ```bash
   alembic stamp head
   ```
